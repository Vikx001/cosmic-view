# üöÄ CosmicView ‚Äî Your Portal to the Stars üåå

**CosmicView** is an immersive, interactive, space-themed web app built with **React**, **Three.js**, and **Tailwind CSS** ‚Äî a stellar fusion of design and data. It's more than just a UI project; it's a cosmic dashboard packed with real-time satellite tracking, dynamic 3D visualizations, API integrations, and user interactivity. 

Behind the scenes, it handles live geospatial data, fetches content from multiple public APIs, renders 3D globes with orbital arcs, embeds external simulation tools, and offers rich visual feedback ‚Äî all while maintaining a smooth, modern user experience.

This makes **CosmicView** a **perfect base-level project** for aspiring web developers who want to:

- Learn how to integrate and sync **multiple real-time APIs** (NASA, SpaceX, Stellarium, etc.)
- Work with **React state management** for complex UIs and data handling
- Explore **3D rendering** using Three.js and `react-globe.gl`
- Build an interactive, **responsive frontend** using Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion
- Understand practical applications of astronomy, satellite data, and frontend design

Whether you're into space, data visualization, or just building something breathtaking ‚Äî CosmicView is the launchpad.
